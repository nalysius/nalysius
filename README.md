# Hi I'm Anthony ðŸ‘‹

After 6 years working as a Rust and PHP developer, I've decided to pursue a
career in cybersecurity in 2022. Today I'm a freelance, and I combine
cybersecurity & development every day to create customized solutions in
order to protect my customers from cyberattacks.  
I like contributing back to open source projects, too.

I do a lot of Rust & Python development, to build efficient software and for
automation.
